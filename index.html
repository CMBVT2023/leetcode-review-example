                &emsp; Biggest takeaway, by far, writing out the pseudo code and working on other problems involving pointers has greatly helped when it comes to solving problems that require similar approaches. While it
                is not wise to try and carbon copy one of my solutions to another problem directly to a new one, it is best to try and adapt it instead. Knowing how to implement a previous pointer solution helped with solving
                this problem. My ease of completion with the pointer aspect of the problem helps to show me that I should focus more on working with similar problems until I am comfortable with them, as opposed to jumping around sporadically learning and having to 
                remember multiple topics while still attempting to learn them.
